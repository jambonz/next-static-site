## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

## Deploy target(s)

This app is currently deploying on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

- [jambonz.vercel.app](https://jambonz.vercel.app)

## Dev start

Clone this repository and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). ***Important for developers: Run a fresh `yarn install` and make sure [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) installs on your local machine*** Your terminal output will show that husky has been installed after yarn resolves packages, something like this:

<img src="/public/husky_screenshot.png" width="224" height="auto" />

### Commands

- `yarn install`
  - Installs node packages
  - Installs [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for git `pre-commit` hooks
  - Husky will run `yarn build` before a git commit and stop the commit if `lint` or `build` fails
- `yarn dev`
  - Serves local dev at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn lint`
  - Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) validations on source JS
  - Install the [ESLint plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint&ssr=false#overview)
- `yarn build && yarn start`
  - Create an optimized Next.js production build and serve it locally
- `yarn build && yarn export`
  - Create a static production export for any static deploy target

### Testing

*Note cypress test suite is still a work in progress*

You can run e2e tests for the site using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io). Cypress specs rely on running the Next.js site on port `3000` as the baseUrl so the best way to test locally is to `yarn dev` in one shell and then `yarn test` in another shell. Optionally, you can `yarn build && yarn start` to create an optimized production server locally and in another shell run `yarn test`. The GitHub workflow for this repository runs the Cypress tests by building and then starting Next.js in the background like `yarn build && (yarn start&) > /dev/null` and then `yarn test`.

Cypress specs are located at `cypress/integration/...`. The source of truth static YAML data should always be used when authoring Cypress tests so we've implemented a script that generates `JSON` data fixtures for Cypress from the YAML data before tests are run. When running `yarn test` what happens is:

* A `pretest` script runs and generates the JSON fixtures for Cypress
* The Cypress tests are run in headless mode
* A `posttest` script runs and performs cleanup on the Cypress fixtures

### Packages

Packages being used prominently in this apps source code are:

* [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
* [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid#react)

## Jambonz UI library

This app is being composed in the manor of `module > component > element`, wherein a page is a module which is made up of components that are comprised of elements. We are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) [SASS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css/css-styling) located in the `styles` directory and loaded globally in [pages/_app.js](/pages/_app.js). A generally simple BEM CSS module naming convention is being used prominently. JS components are in the `components` directory. The `jambonz-ui` component library consists of reusable design element components.

You can view examples of the Jambonz UI component elements on this page [here](https://jambonz.org/jambonz-ui).

### Jambonz Typography

You should always use the reusable components from the `jambonz-ui` component library. These typographic components implement our type-scale for our design system. When styling pages in which we want to adjust or tweak the type-scale you should always use the `mixins` provided in the SASS. This ensures when we decide to break out of our standard type-scale implementation for any given element(s) we retain a harmonious nature to our type sizing as it retains its responsive nature provided by the `mixins`. A perfect example of how we have already done this is for the `docs` page(s) wherein we've chosen to have the `h1` element implement the `h2()` mixin and likewise the `h2` element to implement the `h3()` mixin. We even have the `li` element(s) implementing the `ms()` mixin.

## Static page data

We are using static data with [yamljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs) and [Next.js static props](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation). Data files are located in the `data` directory. There's a JS data utility in `lib/data.js` that provides a method for "fetching" the static data for use with a Next.js pages async `getStaticProps` SSR method.

## Jambonz markdown data

The project is generating some dynamic layouts with markdown files using static file JS utilities alongside Next.js static paths/props system. We are leveraging their [catch-all](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes) dynamic routes logic. Example located at `pages/docs/[[...slug]].js`. The markdown files are in the `markdown` directory organized by subfolders. The markdown navigation structure is controlled in the relevant page YAML data located in the `data` directory for each `markdown` subfolder. You can create markdown files at will but they will not render in the sidebar nav until they are also added to the nav structure in the relevant `data` file. For example, the markdown files for the developer docs are located at `markdown/docs/...` and the YAML data for this layout is located at `data/docs.yml`.

We are using [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), [remark-html](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) and [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) as well as [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) for parsing the docs markdown files. Code syntax highlighting is done with [prismjs](https://prismjs.com) and the associative babel config is in the `.babelrc` file. It's important to leave the preset in this file that merges our config with `next/babel` so Next.js works properly.
