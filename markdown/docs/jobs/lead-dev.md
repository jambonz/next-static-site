# Lead Open Source Developer

[jambonz](https://jambonz.org) and [drachtio](https://drachtio.org) are open source projects that are widely used as the underlying voice platform by some of the largest CX/AI technology companies.  Our growth and success has created a need to expand and we are looking for a highly experienced and highly VoIP lead developer to join our team.

This is a unique opportunity to join an early-stage open source company, work closely with the founding team, and take over increasing responsibility for the future direction of the software while building a sustainable career in the open source RTC community.

**What you will do**

Part of joining a small team means that you will have diverse responsibilities, including: 
- writing software (obviously), 
- doing devops stuff (packaging, CI/CD, etc)
- developing test automation
- writing docs
- helping to grow the open source communities involved with the projects,
- helping drive the roadmap with your ideas,
- supporting customers,
- etc.

Two key points to emphasize: 

First, doing a lot of different things means you must be interested and eager to learn new things - we don't expect you to know them all at the start. We need you to come with some skills, but more important to us is how quickly you can learn new things.

Second: that "supporting customers" thing is key.  Our success follows that of our customers, so part of everyone's job is helping our customers win, and this can involve some amount of after-hours support in responding to critical production issues.

The core of your job will be working to drive our customers' success while adding new features and fixing bugs in the [jambonz](https://github.com/jambonz) software, as well as drachtio [server](https://github.com/drachtio/drachtio-server) and [client](https://github.com/drachtio/drachtio-srf) frameworks. 

**What we are looking for**

First and foremost, we are looking for someone who:

- is a good person - meaning: someone that we can count on; someone that is caring, responsible and accountable,
- has a sense of humor (since we're going to be spending a lot of time together!)
- is a quick learner; also is a good teacher (we are eager to learn what you know!)
- loves writing software; loves making VoIP services; loves seeing customers succeed (because it's more fun to work with people that are passionate!)
- is a proficient English-language speaker (location can be remote).

Beyond that, here are some technical requirements:

- You have past experience building VoIP and SIP server applications.
- You know SIP -- by that I mean the protocol down to a fairly detailed level.
- You have deep expertise building applications in Node.js and consider yourself somewhat of an expert.
- You have past experience building solutions with at least one of the other important RTC open source projects (e.g. Freeswitch, Kamailio, Asterisk, Janus, openSIPs, etc).
- You have experience using drachtio or jambonz? That's highly desirable.  
- You have experience with Kubernetes deployments (and related CI/CD practices)? Also highly desirable.
- You have experience with react and web application development?  Ditto.

We'll also expect to see a lot of your work on github or elsewhere that we can review to get a sense of your skills and experience.

Compensation will be competitive and negotiated based on your level of experience, your location, and your needs.
