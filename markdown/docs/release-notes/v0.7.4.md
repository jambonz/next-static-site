# Release v0.7.4
> Release Date: Mar 17, 2022

#### New Features
- Adds support for using a websocket connection as an alternative to webhooks.
- [config](/docs/webhooks/config/) verb was added to allow session-level speech defaults to be manipulated during a call.
- [gather](/docs/webhooks/gather) and [transcribe](/docs/webhooks/transcribe) now support voice activity detection, which can be used to delay the connection to a speech service until speech is detected.  This can reduce the costs of using some speech providers.
- Allow target-level headers on [dial](/docs/webhooks/dial) verb.
- Add support for handling incoming SIP REFER while in a [dial](/docs/webhooks/dial) verb.
- Additional parameters were added to the [gather](/docs/webhooks/gather) verb.
- Add rate limiting of API requests.
- Add support for redis user/password authentication.

#### Bug fixes
- Rest outdial sometimes failed due to req.srf not properly set.
- When running on kubernetes, use sbc-sip service rather than pinging sbcs.
- Use registered contact as uri when sending to user.
- Disable DNS caching on Kubernetes when routing calls from SBC to feature servers to prevent intermittent failures when service endpoints change.

#### Availability
- Available shortly on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-55wp45fowbovo" target="_blank" >AWS Marketplace</a>
- Deploy to Kubernetes using [this Helm chart](https://github.com/jambonz/helm-charts)
