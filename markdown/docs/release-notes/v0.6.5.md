# Release v0.6.5
> Release Date: August 13, 2021

#### New Features
- You can now monitor your queues in real-time.  At the account level, you can specify a webhook that is called whenever a member joins or leaves a queue.  This enables, for isntance, the possibility of building a webrtc client that shows active state of callers in queue.
- You can now retrieve pcap files from the web UI for your recent calls, in order to see the detailed SIP signaling.

#### Bug fixes
- if waitUrl of enqueue task includes leave but caller is dequeued before leave is reached, ignore leave

- selecting FS to handle createMessage api was improved
- (hosted platform) add limits for adding account-level resources
