#### Bug fixes
- Enqueue waitHook was not working
- Dial verb not ending when call no answer timeout exceeded
- Fix dockerfile security issues
- Hold music was being fetched when conference member removed from hold
- Sending partial transcripts from gather was causing error
- When bargein is disabled, kill the background gather and do not restart it
- Aws region was not being passed to aws tts or stt
- Add alert for jambonz parsing failure 
- Enforce min bargein word count even when we get final transcript
- Add slight delay when releasing media after call answer, to allow A leg ACK transaction to complete on SBC
- When releasing media, use asymetric flag so that rtpengine does react to a spurious final packet from freeswitch by incorrectly sending rtp there
- Adding custom headers to REFER caused preferred hostname on Refer-To to be lost
- MS Teams warm transfer (invite w/replaces) was broken
- Increment sdp version on SIPREC reinvite
- When releasing media anchor from FS, if we are using SRTP on A leg we need to reinvite
- Make rtpengine transcode if non-preferred codec is selected by far end on outdial
