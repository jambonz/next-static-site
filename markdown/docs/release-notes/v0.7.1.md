# Release v0.7.1
> Release Date: Dec 29, 2021

#### New Features
- default options ping interval to 30s, with env override if desired.
- `dial` supports an `overideTo` property in the target array, which sets a To header on the outbound INVITE to a sip uri which can be different than the called number

#### Bug fixes
- Microsoft speech library was not installed properly
- add SIGTERM and SIGUSR2 signal handers to remove feature server from redis set of active servers
- lookupAppByPhoneNumber: pass voip_carrier_sid if available
- support looking up application by regex in addition to exact phone number match
- use of tag resulted in redis insert failures
- support dialing numbers less than 8 digits via SIP trunks since a voip_carrier may handle calls that are not actually routed to the PSTN (e.g. PBX)

#### Availability
- Available now on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-55wp45fowbovo" target="_blank" >AWS Marketplace</a>
