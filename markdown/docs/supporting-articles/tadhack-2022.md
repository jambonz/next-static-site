# TADHack 2022
## Jambonz partners with Cognigy!

Over the past year, we have partnered with Cognigy on the creation of their voice gateway product.  Cognigy decided to build their own voice gateway platform in order to position themselves to develop advanced voice features for their market. They chose to use jambonz at the core of this new product offering, and we are super excited at what they've created!

TADHack 2022 participants will get an early view of this upcoming release, and will be able to build voice applications in Cognigy's best-in-class low code environment.

Best of all, we are giving away $1,000 to the person or team that builds the best hack!
