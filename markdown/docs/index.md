## Welcome, developers!

jambonz is an open-source CPaaS platform that is primarily designed for use by communications service providers.  

As an API-driven platform, you will primarily interface with it using [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/overview/) and [REST APIs](/docs/rest/overview/).  Our client SDKs include a [Node.js SDK](/docs/client-sdks/nodejs-sdk/) SDK as well as [Node-RED plugins](/docs/client-sdks/node-red/).  

There are two ways to run jambonz:
- use our hosted platform (you can [create a free account](https://jambonz.us/register)), or
- self-host your own jambonz system using the open-source distribution.

> Pro tip: Start by creating a free account on the hosted platform because you can start testing immediately. You can always build a self-hosted platform later and migrate your applications seamlessly.

In these  pages you will find information about our SDKs and APIs, along with some useful tips for [getting started](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/) on the hosted platform along with tutorials describing how to perform common tasks.

As always, if you can't find the information you are looking for, please email us at support@jambonz.org and we'll be glad to help!
