# config
> Added in v0.7.4

The `config` verb allows the developer to change the default speech settings for the current session, or to gather speech or dtmf input in the background while other verbs are executing.  The latter technique is useful mainly for certain scenarios when integrating with certain conversational AI systems.

This verb is non-blocking; i.e. the specified settings are changed and execution immediately continues with the next verb in the application.

```json
  {
    "verb": "config",
    "synthesizer": {
      "voice": "Jenny"
    },
    "recognizer": {
      "vendor": "google",
      "language": "de-DE"
    },
    "bargeIn": {
      "enable": true,
      "input" : ["speech"],
      "actionHook: "/userInput"
      }
    }
  },
```
You can use the following attributes in the `config` command:

| option        | description | required  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|amd|enable answering machine detection; see [answering machine detection](/docs/supporting-articles/answering-machine-detection) for details.|no|
|actionHookDelayAction|object, see [here](/docs/supporting-articles/handling-action-hook-delays) for details.|no|
|bargein|this object contains properties that are used to instantiate a 'background' [gather verb](/docs/webhooks/gather).|no|
| bargeIn.enable| if true, begin listening for speech or dtmf input while the session is executing other verbs.  This is known as a "background gather" and an application to capture user input outside of a [gather verb](/docs/webhooks/gather).  If false, stop any background listening task that is in progress.| no|
| bargeIn.sticky | If true and bargeIn.enable is true, then when the background gather completes with speech or dtmf detected, it will automatically start another background gather.|no|
| bargeIn.actionHook | A webhook to call if user input is collected from the background gather.| no |
| bargeIn.input |Array, specifying allowed types of input: ['digits'], ['speech'], or ['digits', 'speech']. | yes |
| bargeIn.finishOnKey | Dmtf key that signals the end of dtmf input. | no |
| bargeIn.numDigits | Exact number of dtmf digits expected to gather. | no |
| bargeIn.minDigits | Minimum number of dtmf digits expected to gather.  Defaults to 1. | no |
| bargeIn.maxDigits | Maximum number of dtmf digits expected to gather. | no |
| bargeIn.interDigitTimeout | Amount of time to wait between digits after minDigits have been entered.| no |
|boostAudioSignal| A string or integer value indicating the number of decibels to boost or reduce the strength of the outgoing audio signal to the caller/called party, e.g. "-6 dB". Note this applies to the main track only, not to any [dub](/docs/webhooks/dub) tracks.| no |
| fillerNoise | play audio to the caller while the remote application is processing gather transcriptions. This is a session-wide setting that may be overridden at the [gather verb](docs/webhooks/gather) level. See [Using filler noise](/docs/supporting-articles/using-filler-noise) for more details.| no |
| fillerNoise.enable | boolean, whether to enable or disable filler noise | yes |
| fillerNoise.url | http(s) audio to play as filler noise | yes |
| fillerNoise.startDelaySecs | integer value specifying number of seconds to wait for a response from the remote application before playing filler noise | no (default: play immediately after sending results) |
| listen | a nested [listen](/docs/webhooks/listen) action, which allows recording of the call from this point forward by streaming the audio to a remote server over a websocket connection | no |
| notifyEvents | boolean, whether to enable event notifications (verb:status messages) over websocket connections.  Verbs that are sent over the websocket must also contain an "id" property to activate this feature.|no|
|onHoldMusic | string, provides the URL to a remote music source to use when a call is placed on hold|no|
| recognizer | change the session-level default speech recognition settings. See [the transcribe verb](/docs/webhooks/transcribe) for details on the `recognizer` property.| no |
| reset | string or array, resets either 'recognizer' and/or 'synthesizer' to the default application settings|no| 
|record|options to manage [call recording using SIPREC](/docs/supporting-articles/siprec-client)|no|
|record.action|"startCallRecording", "stopCallRecording", "pauseCallRecording", or "resumeCallRecording"|yes|
|record.siprecServerURL|sip uri for SIPREC server|required if action is "startCallRecording"|
|record.recordingID|user-supplied string to identify the recording|no|
|transcribe| a nested [transcribe](/docs/webhooks/transcribe) action, which allows a transcription of the call to be sent in the background | no |
|transcribe.enable| boolean, if true start the transcribe, if false stop it | yes |
|transcribe.transcriptionHook| the webhook/websocket identifier to send transcriptions to | yes if enabling transcription |
|transcribe.recognizer| [recognizer](/docs/webhooks/recognizer) options | no |
|sipRequestWithinDialogHook|object or string, a webhook to call when a sip request is received within the dialog (e.g. an INFO, NOTIFY, or REFER)|no|
| synthesizer | change the session-level default text-to-speech settings. See [the say verb](/docs/webhooks/say) for details on the `synthesizer` property.| no |
