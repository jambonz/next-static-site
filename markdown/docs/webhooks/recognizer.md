## Speech-to-text vendors
jambonz natively supports the following speech-to-text services:
- assemblyai
- aws
- azure
- cobalt
- deepgram
- google
- ibm
- nuance
- nvidia
- sonoix

Note: Microsoft supports [on-prem and private link options](/docs/supporting-articles/azure-private-link) for deploying the speech service in addition to the hosted Microsoft service.

<h2 id="hints">Providing speech hints</h2>

google, microsoft, deepgram, and nvidia all support the ability to provide a dynamic list of words or phrases that should be "boosted" by the recognizer, i.e. the recognizer should be more likely to detect this terms and return them in the transcript.  A boost factor can also be applied.  In the most basic implementation it would look like this:

```json
"hints": ["benign", "malignant", "biopsy"],
"hintsBoost": 50
```

Additionally, google and nvidia allow a boost factor to be specified at the phrase level, e.g.

```json
"hints": [
  {"phrase": "benign", "boost": 50},
  {"phrase": "malignant", "boost": 10},
  {"phrase": "biopsy", "boost": 20},
]
```

The value provided must be iether a number of milliseconds or 'false' to disable the feature entirely.  Note: the default endpointing value that Deepgram uses is 10 milliseconds.  You can set this value higher to allow to require more silence before a final transcript is returned but we suggest a value of 1000 (one second) or less, as we have observed strange behaviors with higher values.  If you wish to allow more time for pauses during a conversation before returning a transcript, we suggest using the utteranceEndMs feature instead that is described below. | no (default: 10ms) |
