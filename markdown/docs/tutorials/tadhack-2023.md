# TADHack 2023

### Developer resources

jambonz is excited as ever to sponsor TADHACK 2023.  For those developers that wish to create a hack using jambonz, all you need to do is to go to [jambonz.cloud](https://jambonz.cloud/register) and create a free account.  You will get a free 3-week trial and to extend it beyond that simply email us at support@jambonz.org when your trial expires.  Let us know you are part of TADHACK and we will renew it for you through the hackathon.

If you can, take a few moments to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/A73PDIpoy_8) which will show you the basics of setting up your  account on jambonz.cloud.

Other videos that may be helpful if you are getting started on jambonz:
- [building applications using Node.js](https://youtu.be/42jcqyvCstU)
- Sam Machin's video on [building applications using Node-RED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6cSbxjXS4)

And, of course, please refer to to our [docs page](/docs/webhooks/overview) and [api docs](https://api.jambonz.org).

Oh, and if you prefer, you can also [build a jambonz application using websockets](/docs/ws/overview) instead of webhooks.  So lots of choices.

**Most Importantly** join our Slack community by going to [joinslack.jambonz.org](https://joinslack.jambonz.org) so you can ask for help before or during the hackathon from the jambonz team as well as the broader community.

Good hacking!  Make something fun!
