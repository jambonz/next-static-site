# Icons

Jambonz UI utilizes [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/), a wonderful open-source icon library available in many formats for implemention into frontend stacks. While feather has 280+ available icons the Jambonz UI library only imports and thus provides a small subset of those from [react-feather](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather). This allows for tree-shaking to take effect and ensures we don't load extra bloat into our dist JS that isn't explicitly used. As use cases arise we can, and will, pull more icons into the main package. For now you can use the following icons in your jambonz apps. For more information see docs on the [Icon component](/docs/jambonz-ui/components/).
