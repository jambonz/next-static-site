# Components

The UI library would not be complete without some atomic components for use in your jambonz apps. Currently there are components for normalized typography, iconography and buttons. As jambonz frontend development continues to mature new use cases will become viable candidates to incorporate into this UI kit, form elements being the most notable upcoming candidates.

It's worth noting that these components leverage the [styles]() from the UI kit. So you can use the CSS selectors directly in your jambonz app components or you can leverage these components for a more streamlined approach. However you choose to do it is totally fine. This library is unopinionated about that. It simply aims to provide the foundation for "on brand" jambonz apps peppered with a little variety.
