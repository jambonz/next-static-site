# Components

The UI library would not be complete without some atomic components for use in your jambonz apps.
Currently there are components for normalized typography, iconography and buttons. As jambonz frontend
development continues to mature new use cases will become viable candidates to incorporate into this
UI kitâ€”form elements being the most notable upcoming candidates.

The component library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) so it supports
jambonz apps also using TypeScript. it also requires that some JS peer dependencies are met in your
jambonz app. These are likely the most common, however it's worth noting that you can also use the
library with [preact](https://preactjs.com/).

This page has some basic overview tables of the components but the best place to check them out is
on the [storybook](https://jambonz-ui.vercel.app/) site for `jambonz-ui`.

| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| children  | Will render any children                                                          |
| mainStyle | Currenly the only valid value is `hollow`                                         |
| subStyle  | Valid values are `dark`, `blue`, `teal`, `purple`, `white`                        |
| as        | Render as either `next/link` or `react-router-dom` link                           |

| href      | Use with `next/link`                                                              |
| ...rest   | Props are spread so you can pass extra attributes like `type="submit` for buttons |

###### ButtonGroup

| className | Any valid `className` string                      |
| set       | Boolean, will add `ico--set` className if present |

###### Typography H[1-6], P, M, MS and MXS

All of these accept the same type of props with the exception of `M`, `MS` and `MXS` not spreading `rest` props.

| Props    | Value(s)                                                                                                              |

| ...rest  | Props are spread so you can pass extra attributes like `className`. Note that `M`, `MS` and `MXS` don't support this. |

##### Using components

You can import available components from the package into your jambonz app JS.

```jsx
import { ButtonGroup, Button, Icon } from "@jambonz/ui-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup className="pad">
      <Button mainStyle="hollow">
        <Icons.GitHub />
        <span>github.com/jambonz</span>
      </Button>
      <Button mainStyle="hollow">
        <Icons.GitHub />
        <span>github.com/drachtio</span>
      </Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}
```

##### Notes on Button as Link (polymorphic)

The `Button` component takes a few props that are specific to rendering a link element, `<a>`,
with button styles. If you just need a button, you can ignore these props. But if you would like
links to be styled like buttons (CTAs) and you want them to route within the [React](https://reactjs.org/)
context you can do that. The distinction between which one has to do with passing either the `to` or
the `href` props that are passed on to the `Link` component in question.

Using the `Link` prop with [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/components/link).

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Button } from "@jambonz/ui-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button as={Link} to="/someurl/" subStyle="dark">
      Some text
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Using the `Link` prop with [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { Button } from "@jambonz/ui-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button as={Link} href="/someurl/" subStyle="dark">
      Some text
    </Button>
  );
}
```

##### Importing your icon set

By default the UI library doesn't import any icons from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/),
however it declares [react-feather](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather) as a peer dependency.
This means you can import just the icons you are using in your jambonz app. This allows for
[tree-shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) to take effect and ensures
we don't load extra bloat into our dist JS that isn't explicitly used. The `Icon` component renders a
stylized design icon with many visual variations.

You can see how we import the feather icons used on this site
[here](https://github.com/jambonz/next-static-site/blob/main/src/components/icons.js).
But for a quick reference here is a compressed example.

First we create a module in our jambonz app and import the icons we would
like to use and export them for use in the rest of the app.

```jsx
import {
  X,
  Lock,
  Send,
  Menu,
  Phone,
  Heart,
  ExternalLink,
  // ...
} from "react-feather";

export const Icons = {
  X,
  Lock,
  Send,
  Menu,
  Phone,
  Heart,
  ExternalLink,
  // ...
};

export default Icons;
```

Then we can use these icons both `inline` and with the `Icon` component for stylized designer icons.

```jsx
import { Icons } from "./my-icons";
import { Icon } from "@jambonz/ui-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Icon mainStyle="hollow" subStyle="dark">
        <Icons.Heart />
      </Icon>
      <Link href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/60530395/Objectivity-Free-Font-Family">
        <a className="i" target="_blank">
          <span>design</span>
          <Icons.ExternalLink />
        </a>
      </Link>
    </>
  );
}
```
