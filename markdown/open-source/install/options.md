The recommended way to trial the jambonz software is to [create an account](https://jambonz.cloud/register) on the hosted jambonz system, since this allows you to get up and running in minutes without building servers.  Plus, you can always migrate to a self-hosted system at any time with no changes to your application.

If you wish to self-host a jambonz system you can use the [AWS Marketplace offering](https://blog.jambonz.org/installing-jambonz-using-aws-marketplace) which provides a single jambonz instance running on one server (what we call a "jambonz mini").

For other deployments including clustered jambonz solutions we encourage you to reach out to us for a [paid support plan](/support).  Our team will help  you deploy jambonz on the hosting provider of your choice or even bare metal servers and will tune and provide ongoing maintenance and upgrades. Customers on paid support plans enjoy a variety of benefits, including:
- access to private customer-only devops and deployment scripts
- initial system build and test performed by our team, working with you
- ongoing updates applied by our team in maintenance windows of your choosing
- prioritization of your bug fixes and feature requests
- creation of a private Slack channel where your team can work directly with our engineers
- a dedicated engineer from the jambonz team assigned to your account as your primary contact.

If you are serious about deploying jambonz as a mission-critical element of your business, it's a no-brainer to have the folks that developed jambonz working alongside your team to help you win.  

Paid support and services are also the primary means of financial support for the project, so by purchasing a support plan you are helping ensure a vibrant future for the product. Email us at support@jambonz.org to ask about our support plans.
