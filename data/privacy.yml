      - In order to provide you with the service, jambonz needs to collect some personal information about you.
      - Additionally, you may have end user customers that access the jambonz service, and in the course of providing these peoplewith service we may end up collecting some information about them as well.  To keep things straight, we'll refer to you as the "Customer", and your end users as "End Users".
      - Whew!  Now, with that out of the way, let's review some basic facts about privacy which we think you should be aware of.

    title: About Customer Data
    text:
      - We do not shareyour data with any third party, unless it is necessary to provide the service, or we are required to by law.  In no cases do we sell your data to any third party.
      - The primary personal information we collect about you is your email address, which we use as a form of identification within the system and to be able to reach out to you for things like password reset requests, etc.  You can also create an account on jambonz using Google or Github as an oauth provider, and if you grant this access, we will retrieve and store your email address and name from those providers.
      - If you sign up for a paid plan, we will direct you to our third-party billing partner (currently Stripe) to enter your credit card details.  We do not have access to your credit card number or CVC, nor do we store those in our database or anywhere on our servers.
      - To work with your preferred carriers and speech service providers, you will need to provide us some information about those vendors and services.  We will store this information in our databaseto utilize these services on your behalf.  You can change or delete this information at any time from our system, and all related information will be removedfrom all our systems immediately.
      - We will also collect IP addresses that you use to access the the service from.  In some cases, such as when we need to direct calls to devices you have registered, we will store these IP addresses in our database for a short period of time.
      - You can delete your jambonz account at any point in time, and we will remove your account and substantially all your data immediately.  We may retain a minimum amount of data necessary for activities like resolving disputes, analyzing, and improving system performance, etc.

    title: About End-User Data
    text: 
      - While making calls, your End User customers may share private and confidential information over the audio connection established through jambonz -- e.g., credit card numbers, account numbers etc.  We never store audio recordings -- or transcriptions of audio recordings -- in our databases or on our servers, so this kind of information about your End User customers can never be exposed from our systems.  We thought you'd you want to know this.
      - While delivering calls for your End Users, we will receive information such as the phone numbers and IP addresses they are calling from, the numbers or other identifiers of the people, services, or devices they are trying to reach, along with information like the time and length of the call, etc.  This information is typically referred to as a "Call Detail Record" and unless you modify your account settings (see the next point below) we will store Call Detail Records for your end users in our database.
      - You can opt out of Call Detail Record reporting by disabling the feature in the self-service portal.  If you do choose to opt out, the only information we will store about your End Users will be the IP addresses of devices that they register to make/receive calls because this information is needed to successfully provide that service.End User IP address information is only stored in our database for a period of one hour from the most successful recent device registration request.

    title: Location of Service
    text:
      - Our servers are located in the USA, and your calls (media and signaling) will transit through these servers.

    title: A Few Words about GDPR
    text:
      - <b>The General Data Protection Regulation</b> (GDPR) in the European Economic Area (EEA) distinguishes between data "controllers" and "processors".  A controller decides why and how to process personal information.  A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controllerâ€™s instructions.
      - jambonz is primarily a data controller; we use information included in the Customer Data such as your carrier sip trunk details and speech credentials as part of our legitimate interest of providing you with the service you expect.
      - When handling calls from your End Users, jambonz also acts as a data processor, in that we are processing End User data such as phone numbers and IP addresses under your instructions for routing and managing the end user's calls.
      - "Under the GDPR, you have the right to:"

          - Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
          - Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
          - Opt-out from our communications.  Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related messages.
          - Object to processing of your personal data, for example, if we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this basis.
          - Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
          - Request the transfer of your personal data to another party (right to data portability).
