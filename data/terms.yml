    title: 1.	JAMBONZ SERVICES
    text:
      - This is a beta. You must not rely on it or use it for anything where it would be a problem if it did not work at all or did not work properly. We will try to keep the service available and functioning for the duration of the beta, but we do not guarantee to do so. Basically, we hope it works, and we'll probably try to fix important things if we find they don't work, but we're not responsible or liable to you if it doesn't work, or if we don't fix it.
      - We may change or discontinue any or all of the jambonz Services or change or remove functionality of any or all of the jambonz Services during the beta period. We will do our best to notify you in advance of planned changes.

    title: 2.	PERIOD OF THE BETA
    text:
      - The Beta is expected to run for a period of two months or so from late May-July 2021.  We may extend or contract the length of the beta based on our assessment of how it is going.  Our intention is to launch a production release on completion of the beta, but we reserve the right to decide when and if there will be a production release of the jambonz cloud services.

    title: 3.	TERMS AND TERMINATION
    text:
      - We reserve the right to cancel your service at any time during the beta, and for any reason at all, or for no reason.  In practice, we only foresee this happening if your actions are somehow impeding the beta process, causing harm to our systems or other systems or users, or are deemed by us to be malicious in any way.

    title: 4.	PAYMENTS
    text:
      - The beta is free of charge.  The credit card payment functionality will be operating in a test-only mode during the beta, and if you are willing to help us test it, we may issue you a test credit card number that will enable you to do so.
